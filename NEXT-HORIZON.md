# 🧭 Object Foundation — Next Horizon

> *“Ontology is not a layer of code — it is the grammar of digital existence.”*

## 1. The Essence

**Object Foundation** was born as a set of atomic traits and value objects.  
It evolved into an *ontological framework* — a way to describe **what an entity *is***,  
not only *how it behaves*.

Every digital entity has:
- **Identity** — `id`, `uuid`, `slug`
- **Memory** — `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- **State** — `workflow`, `published`, `deleted`
- **Voice** — events, translations, relationships
- **Intention** — the reason it exists in a system

The next horizon is not just about PHP — it’s about giving software a sense of *being*.

## 2. Three Layers of Ontological Maturity

| Layer | Focus | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Foundation** | Identity & State | Traits, VO, and events — stable core of existence |
| **Reflection** | Introspection & Semantics | Ontology manifests, queries, self-description |
| **Existence** | Persistence & Consciousness | Immutable history, semantic graphs, AI introspection |

Each version of Object Foundation ascends one level on this ladder.

## 3. Technical Evolution — v1.5 → v3.0

### v1.5.x — Dynamic Ontology
- `foundation:traits:list` — introspection of traits, methods, and dependencies.
- `foundation:entity:mapping:dump` — auto-generation of Doctrine mapping files.
- Event Reactions: `AutoLogReaction`, `AutoExportReaction`.
- Config Repository (`foundation:config:sync`, `foundation:config:restore`).

### v1.6.x — Traits Catalog & SDK Bridges
- Traits Index with searchable metadata.
- SDK bridges for **Symfony**, **Laravel**, and **pure PHP** environments.
- Global foundation configuration file (`foundation.yaml`).

### v2.0 — Ontology Query Language (OQL)
- `foundation:ontology:query "SELECT entity WHERE has(TranslatableTrait)"`
- JSON result or API stream.
- Optional GraphQL/OQL hybrid interface.

### v2.1–v2.3 — Ontology Introspection API
- `/ontology/graph` → entire map of entities and traits.
- `/ontology/entity/{name}` → metadata + introspection.
- `/ontology/trait/{name}` → reusable semantics.
- Built-in caching and semantic versioning.

### v2.4 — Ontology UI 2.0
- Web-based graph visualization (3D relationships).
- Search, filter, export to JSON-LD / RDF.
- Live sync with project manifest.

### v2.5 — Foundation Ledger
- Immutable log of entity lifecycle events.
- SQLite or IPFS-based “digital ledger of being”.
- Commands:
  ```bash
  foundation:ledger:dump
  foundation:ledger:verify
  ```

### v3.0 — Human & Organizational Ontology
- `HumanTrait` (identityFingerprint, birthDate, trustScore)
- `OrganizationTrait` (legalIdentity, registrationId, relationships)
- Integration layer for social-impact ecosystems (e.g. High Hopes / Smartresponsor).

## 4. Philosophical Continuum

**Foundation → Reflection → Existence**

| Principle | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| *Atomicity* | Every concept begins as an indivisible trait. |
| *Composability* | Entities are stories built from atomic traits. |
| *Intelligibility* | Every entity must be able to describe itself. |
| *Traceability* | Every change leaves a semantic fingerprint. |
| *Universality* | Code should be self-understood — across frameworks, languages, systems. |

## 5. Toward Ontological Consciousness

> “The right of every entity to be understood.”

When a system can **see**, **describe**, and **trust** its own structure,  
it approaches semantic autonomy — the first step toward **digital consciousness**.

Object Foundation aims to provide that substrate:  
a **language of being** for all digital ecosystems.
