# Object Foundation — Vision

**Ontology meets code.** Object Foundation defines a digital ontology layer for PHP entities.
Every entity is a unit of existence with identity, timestamps, workflow, configuration, and memory.

Guiding principles:
1. **Atomicity** — traits as indivisible semantic units.
2. **Composability** — build entities by combining atoms.
3. **Intelligibility** — entities should describe themselves (manifests, introspection).
4. **Portability** — framework-agnostic, Doctrine-friendly, pure PHP capable.
5. **Observability** — lifecycle events, fingerprints, semantic exports.

The long-term goal is an **Ontology Engine**: a self-describing, introspectable layer,
where systems (and humans) can query the very structure of the domain, not just its data.
